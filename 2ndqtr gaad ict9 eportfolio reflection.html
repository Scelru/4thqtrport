Another quarter of 9th Grade is about to end, and I would like to share my experiences throughout this 2nd Quarter.
<br><br>
This quarter is more focused on CSS coding. While we had discussed about CSS last year, it was only the basics. This year teaches us more to CSS coding, like the different CSS styles, CSS selectors, classes, and how we can format text and layouts with CSS.
<br><br>
With the addition of CSS, I could improve the appearance and formatting of my portfolio, and seeing the successful browser outputs made me enjoy coding this E-Portfolio.
<br><br>
I want to keep studying and working hard, as there are still periodicals in this coming week, so I will be able to answer and pass easily.
<br><br>
And lastly, I would like to thank Ms. Uminga  once again, for continuing to be a good teacher to us, even if she cannot always make it to class, I still appreciate her and pray for her health. I will keep looking forward to coding as we learn more! Thank you!
